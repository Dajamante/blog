      <h3>What is that all about?</h3>
      <p>
        This blog is a collection of solutions to competitive programming
        problems from different judges online, mostly
        <a href="www.kattis.com"> kattis</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I struggled with most of those and they taught me a lot (painfully). My
        solutions are in no way (thank goodness!) a set of best practices or
        best solutions. Competitive programming is just a way to learn
        programming and have fun.

      <h3>About this site</h3>
      <p>
        This blog is made with Gatsby. I wanted something fast, minimal and
        easy, so I considered WordPress. But my friend advised against it (...
        <i>
          "wordpress is a monster of possible mistakes layered on top of each
          other!"
        </i>{" "}
        were his exact words.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I really don't regret Gatsby. It's fast, it has hot reload, and the
        community is great. Problem is:{" "}
        <strong>the learning curve is steep. And going downwards. </strong>
      </p>

        You just had time to get css grids, but now The Cool Kids of Front
        End&#174; {` `} do React. You just understand what a React component is,
        but TCKoFE do Styled Components now! So expect some agressive
        maintenance along the way.

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I live in Stockholm, and some days my programming go as smoothly as
        A&#65284;AP's routine visit to our beautiful city.

        My French is also very good, so my dream is to make it to the National
        French Team of Sweden (of whatever is available...){" "}
