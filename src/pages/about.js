        This blog is a collection of solutions to programming problems from
        different competitive programming websites, mostly
        <a href="www.kattis.com"> kattis</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I struggled with most of those and they taught me a lot (painfully). My
        solutions are in no way (thank goodness!) a set of best practices or
        best solutions. It is just a way to learn programming and have fun.

      <p>
        More about me: I live in Stockholm, and some days my programming go as
        smoothly as A&#65284;AP's routine visit to our beautiful city.

        My French is also very good, so my dream is to make it to the National
        French Team of Sweden (of whatever is available...){" "}
