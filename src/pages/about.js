      This blog is a collection of programming problems that I struggled with or
      found really fun, and problems who taught me a lot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those solutions are in no way (thank goodness!) a set of best practices.
      It is just a way to learn programming and have fun.

      More about me: I live in Stockholm, and sometimes my programming go as bad
      as the usual night out of A&#65284;AP Rocky in our beautiful town. My
      French is also very good so my dream is to make it to the National French
      Team of Sweden (of whatever is left...){" "}
